Oni Express
===========

ðŸ‘¹ni: a modular, scalable, searchable data repository.

Datasets are stored on disk according to the [Oxford Common File Layout - OCFL](https://ocfl.io/) - a standard for maintaining immutable, platform-independent file-based repositories.

Datasets are described using [RO-Crate](https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/) - a lightweight standard for research metadata based on [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) and [Schema.org](https://schema.org/).

Datasets are indexed into a [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) database, providing high-performace faceted search and discovery based on selected metadata fields.

## Components

This repository contains the core component, **oni-express** - a Node web app  with three endpoints:

* a single-page app with search and browse interface
* a proxy for the Solr index
* an OCFL bridge which serves versioned datastreams from the repository

[**oni-portal**](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/oni-portal) is the repository for the single-page app's JavaScript. There isn't any need to install it separately unless you're developing custom components: the oni-express deployment (see below) will deploy and configure the appropriate release for you.

[**oni-indexer**](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/oni-indexer) is a stand-alone node script which traverses the OCFL repository and builds the Solr index. 

## Deploying Oni

The easiest way to deploy Oni is with the Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` in this repository. Put your OCFL repository in the directory called `sample_ocfl` in this distribution, or, alternately, follow the steps in the section OCFL and Solr below to configure a link to an OCFL repository somewhere else on your system.

Then start Docker with:

    > docker-compose up

The data portal should be available on https://localhost:8080/

## Configuring and indexing

### OCFL and Solr

The `docker-compose.yml` file maps a directory on the host system to `/etc/share/ocfl` on the Docker container where the oni-express app can serve it.

This directory should be the directory which contains your OCFL repository, not the OCFL repository itself. The root directory of the OCFL repository will also need to be configured in the `config.json` file for oni-express.

As an example, say that the root of your OCFL repository on the host system is: 

    /opt/share/ocfl/repository

Then the `docker-compose.yml` should be configured as follows:

    services:
      oni-express:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        expose:
          - "80"
        networks:
          - main
        volumes:
          - "/opt/share/ocfl:/etc/share/ocfl"

The `ocfl` section of `config.json` should be configured as follows (note that this is the path to the OCFL repository on the Docker container, not the host):

    "ocfl": {
      "sample_ocfl": {
        "repository": "/etc/share/ocfl/repository",
    
        [...]

The `apis` section of `portal.config.json` needs to be configured to match the name of the OCFL repository in the `config.json` file:

    "apis": {
        "ocfl": "/ocfl/repository",
        "solr": "/solr/ocfl"
    },

Finally, the `config.json` file for oni-indexer needs to be configured to point to your OCLF repository on the host system:
 
    {
      "ocfl": "/opt/share/ocfl/repository",
      "identifierNamespace": "ocfl",
      "uriIds": "identifiers",
      "updateSchema": true,
    
      [...]
 

### Indexing





### Web server

The oni-express web server is configured with `/config/config.json`

The base config is divided into environments, for example:

* development
* uat
* production

Each environment contains the following sections:

#### auth

Auth can be omitted if you want to run oni-express without authentication.

At the moment, the only authentication protocol supported is the Australian Access Federation's [AAF Rapid Connect](https://rapid.aaf.edu.au/). Development of an Azure AD connector is underway.

* secret - key obtained when registering the AAF Rapid Connect endpoint
* authURL - URL obtained when registering the AAF Rapid Connect endpoint
* iss - either "https://rapid.test.aaf.edu.au" or "https://rapid.test.aaf.edu.au"
* aud - the domain this instance of Oni is running on
* success - the jwt endpoint, usually "http://oni.domain/jwt",
* attributes - "https://aaf.edu.au/attributes",
* allow - a set of regexps to be matched against attribute values, for eg:
  - "uid": "uts.edu.au"
  - "affiliation": "^staff@uts.edu.au$"


#### session

Configuration options for the session cookies used if authentication is on. The only value you need to change is `secret`, which should be given something unique and secret.

* secret - Salt for session fingerprinting. Change this to a random value.
* name - Cookie session name
* expiry - Session cookie expiry time in hours
* server - location of the memcached server on the Docker network

#### cors

Enables CORS so that oni can run in dev mode with components on different domains, which would otherwise be blocked by browsers. This should be set to `false` when running in production.

#### solr

Address of the Solr server on the Docker network. You shouldn't have to change this.

#### ocfl

Configures at least one OCFL repository, as follows:

* repository - directory of the repository on the Docker container - see the section on OCFL and Solr above for details
* autoindex - allow auto-indexes for the top level and inside OCFL objects
* versions - allow URLS to return versions other than HEAD
* type - filter objects by their type in the Solr index
* page_size - number of items to return on an auto-index page
* solr - URL of this repositories Solr core
* resolver - whether to use solr or pairtree to resolve URLs to OCFL paths

### Portal

The data portal is configured with `/config/portal.config.json`, which is copied to the oni-express Docker container when rebuilding.


## Limitations

A future release will make it more convenient to deploy the OCFL bridge without the web front-end, to meet use cases where the search/discovery portal is not required.

At present, it still needs to be installed and configured separately to oni-express. A future release will bundle oni-indexer into the Docker stack for oni-express so this won't be necessary.

## Roadmap

## History

## Oni?

The original oni ðŸ‘¹ is a Japanese ogre - kind of shaggy and fierce, though they have their softer side in some legends - and the name is a loose acronym:

O - OCFL Objects
n - nginx or node (or whatever else moves datastreams over the network)
i - index

It's not ONI, though, it's Oni.
